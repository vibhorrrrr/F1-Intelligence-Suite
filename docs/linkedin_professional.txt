🏎️ Built a Full-Scale F1 Strategy Intelligence Suite

I just completed a production-grade F1 race strategy platform that goes way beyond a simple dashboard. This is the closest I've gotten to building a real F1 pit-wall strategy tool.

✅ ML-Based Lap Time Predictor
   → RandomForest model with ±0.05s accuracy
   → 12 engineered features (tire deg, fuel, track evolution)
   → Trained on 10,000+ synthetic race scenarios

✅ Monte Carlo Race Simulation
   → 500-2000 scenarios per strategy
   → Probabilistic safety car & weather events
   → Confidence intervals & win probability

✅ Live Telemetry Dashboard
   → Real-time race simulation with 20 drivers
   → Complete race finish logic & classification
   → Track map visualization with live positions
   → Restart capability for multiple scenarios

✅ Safety Car & Weather-Aware Strategy
   → SC/VSC probability modeling by lap & track type
   → Strategic pit window detection
   → Rain onset prediction & crossover points

✅ Advanced Opponent Modeling
   → Predict competitor pit strategies
   → Undercut/overcut opportunity detection
   → Position battle simulation
